# Floor_SAM
This paper proposes a LiDAR point cloud indoor floor plan reconstruction method based on multi-dimensional information union, combining the point cloud density map with the zero-shot segmentation capability of SAM to achieve efficient and robust indoor floor plan reconstruction.
Our code will be fully released after the paper is accepted.
